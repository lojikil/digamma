; A Digamma->C compiler that supports the full Digamma spec (including POSIX & W7).
; it's probably a crappy method of compilation, but it eases transition, since it
; reuses Vesta's runtime. The Best method would be to have a nice Type inference system
; that uses something similar to a tagged pointer for SExprs, rather than the heavy struct/union
; I use now. On top of that, I could unbox many things; this is definitely the tact I will take
; with future releases, but for now I'm just looking to speed up Digamma development & run times

; The basic system is this:
; - read form from file
; - call syntax-expand
; - call macro-expand
; - call gen-code on what's left
; - loop to the first item until #e
