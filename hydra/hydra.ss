;; TODO:
;; - good compilation mechanism for hydra@eval
;; - method for vm@eval to manage things like (cons (car (cons 1 2)) (cdr (1 2)))
;;   which it cannot currently do because we need to rotate the stack (wait, do we?)
;;   (cons (car (cons 1 '())) (cdr 4 '())):
;;   (4)   ;; nil
;;   (3 4) ;; load 4
;;   (2)   ;; cons
;;   (1)   ;; cdr
;;   (4)   ;; nil
;;   (3 1) ;; load 1
;;   (2)   ;; cons
;;   (0)   ;; car
;;   (2)   ;; cons
;;   works, so this isn't blocked. \o/
;; - lambda lifting: it would be nice if lambdas were lifted to avoid allocation as
;;   much as possible
;; - define-instruction syntax that can be used to populate vm@eval as well as 
;;   clean up redundancies in code (like manual calls to vm@eval in each instruction)
;; - define a clean method of boxed representations of types, one that can be used from
;;   Vesta or E'. Not sure if this is a decent use of time here, in a VM, since that 
;;   should be a function of the run time, not the interpreter (we wouldn't want Ceres
;;   & Hydra to have different representations, for instance). Still, it would be nice
;;   if errors & other types can be simply encoded '(error "error"); SRFI-9, esp. if it
;;   has E' support, might be a good option (need to unbox types in E' though, for the
;;   most efficient representation, as well as unions).
;; - Make all instructions support (type . value) pairs, so as to avoid a situation where
;;   the user enters the code (0 (list 1 2 3)) and recieves the value 1 back, because:
;;   (load 0)
;;   (call) ;; call integer 0, since integers -> primitives, this can add some weird behavior.
;; - Just noticed that the way the CALL operand is implemented, the stack will no longer
;;   hold the parameters. Need to walk over the params to a lambda & bind variables from the
;;   stack before moving to running the code...
;; I wonder if this should re-write to %define, so that I don't have
;; to do anything fancy with eval... There are three cases:
;; (define f literal)
;; (define f (fn (x) (+ x x)))
;; (define f (car '(1 2 3 4 5)))
;; the first two *can* be handled OOB by hydra@eval, but the third
;; cannot really be handled properly. It should be re-written to 
;; (load (1 2 3 4 5))
;; (car)
;; (load f)
;; (%define)

(define (list-copy l)
    " really, should be included from SRFI-1, but this simply makes a copy
      of the spine of a pair
      "
    (if (null? l)
        l
        (cons (car l) (list-copy (cdr l)))))

(define (vm@instruction c)
    (car c))

(define (vm@operand c)
    (cadr c))

(define (vm@eval code env (ip 0) (stack '()) (dump '()))
     " process the actual instructions of a code object; the basic idea is that
       the user enters:
       h; (car (cdr (cons 1 (cons 2 '()))))
       which is compiled by hydra@eval into:
       (4)   ;; nil
       (3 2) ;; load 2
       (2)   ;; cons
       (3 1) ;; load 1
       (2)   ;; cons
       (1)   ;; cdr
       (0)   ;; car
       
       which vm@eval can then interpret in a tail-call fashion.
       There might be better ways to store the actual VM codes themselves
       other than pairs of pairs (even vector of pairs would be more efficient really)
       and it might be worth it to add two collexion-neutral primitives, cappend & 
       cappend!, to the collexion API. Also, adding named-enumerations to the language,
       even if at the syntactic level, would be helpful. If (enumerate OPCAR OPCDR ...)
       even compiled to
       #define OPCAR 0
       #define OPCDR 1
       // ...
       
       It would be more useful, and the names could be used throughout (and checked!)."
     ;; if this is moved to an IP-based (instruction pointer)
     ;; system, it might be easier to do this using a named-let rather than iterating 
     ;; at the top level. E' should be able to lift named-lets pretty easily into whiles
     ;; and that would fit pretty well here. Also, moving to an inner-loop with named-let
     ;; means I can alliviate some of the duplication here; code & env are rarely modified
     ;; so it would also make sense to not have to pass them on every call. A lot of
     ;; duplication...
     ;; also, I would really like to have these all defined using a Scheme48-style
     ;; define-operator, since that would be much cleaner than what is seen below.
     ;; Syntax could expand the full list of operators in place here, and it would make
     ;; expanding the set of operators *much* easier than it currently is.
