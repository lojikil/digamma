(define-route "/" ; support put, delete, &c &c
	:post index-post
	:get index-get)

(application-load "simpleapp" :context "/simpleapp")
(application-load "fwa-admin" :context "/admin")
; make this like tomcat: when you do some action to the admin
; it should scan the "web app" directory & load any new web apps
